Automating the submit Button and Verifying the Sucess Message 

The tutorial demostrates a practical example of using XPath and CSS selector

1. Clicking the Submit Button 

The submit button on the form doesn't have a unique ID or name. However, it does have a type attribute with the value submit 

//input[type='submit']

driver.find_element(By.XPath, "//input[type='submit']")

.click() 

Grabing and validating the success Message

After the form is submitted, a success message appears. The speaker explains how to locate this message and verify its content 

The success message has a class attribute with multiple values: 

"alert", "alert-success", and "alert-dismissible" 

The speaker chooses to use "alert-success"  as the class name locator because it's specific to the success message 

driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "alert-success")



Retriving text: To validate the message, you need to get the text from the element. 

.text: This property retrieves the visible text content of the element 

The code stores the retrieved text in a variable: 

message = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "alert-success").text 

Assertion for Validation: 

The speaker introduces the assert statement to validate that the retrieved message is correct. An assertion is a key part of automated testing
